# octoprint-discord-bot
a Discord Bot that let you view your Octoprint Status remotely

this is everything you need to get the bot up and running

I've moved all the documentations to the [wiki](https://github.com/ChokunPlayZ/octoprint-discord-bot/wiki)

Features

 - Multiple Printers
 - get printers status / print job progress
 - get webcam still shot

I will update more in the future 
you can request a feature in the issue section
any recomendations is very welcome

**To-do List**
 - [x] Show printing status in status command (or a seperate command)
 - [x] change the printer selector to button (name can be hard to remember)
 - [ ] change The Database to SQLite so you can store more data
 - [ ] pause / stop print from your discord text channel (start print can be dangerous so big NO)
 - [ ] Webcam Streaming to Voice Channel (it's impossible due to API limitations, i will add it as soon as discord allows it)
 - [ ] get raspberry pi temperature (you may need a plugin)
 - [ ] smart plug support (intregated with Octoprint or Homeassistant) (maybe Tasmota Intregation)
 - [ ] update Alert (still need to figure out how to do it once I can it would be very useful)
